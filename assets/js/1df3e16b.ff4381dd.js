The problem stemmed from a mismatch in the model interface and a missing bash command in the package.json for the 'extract-version' script. A simple fix was suggested: commenting out the mistral references if not needed and adding 'bash' to the command. Additionally, user Pouncer inquired about managing secrets for multiple characters running locally and on a VPS. User odilitime advised creating separate projects for each agent to manage settings effectively. User elizaos pointed out the 'secrets' variable in the defaultCharacter.ts file as a starting point for Pouncer's inquiry.
