NotebookLM and similar research tools can extract specific technical discussions, discover new connections, and track project evolution through these as sources.\\n\\nBelow is a complete list of all WDYGDTW session recordings. These videos can be imported into tools like Google\'s [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) via youtube video import for deeper analysis, transcript generation, and pattern recognition across the development timeline:\\n\\n[![image](/blog/notebooklm.jpg)](https://notebooklm.google.com/)\\n\\n**Youtube**\\n\\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EmvhlBPB8Q\\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbvv0Dr91Bc\\n3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUAEQ7uKi04\\n4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3Z4lvu_ic4\\n5. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u8rbjmvWC0\\n6. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3auUQj9oEg\\n7. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcSF7dSicTI\\n8. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs7D5DN_trk\\n9. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqM_vYK2bmc\\n10. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1voboZEQTAw\\n11. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxdWvBnxN8M\\n12. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZNuoXJ1Mvs\\n\\n**Notes**\\n\\n1.

We may bring this format back, but we also want to continue the spirit of public accountability and transparent development through other community initiatives to keep things fresh. One such example is [Clank Tank](https://m3org.com/tv), where a standup becomes a pitch to AI judges that give you feedback about your project."}]}}')}}]);
